## Description

TNTRun is a highly configurable, fully automated minigame for Minecraft servers. Traditionally players start on a layer of sand supported by TNT blocks, although any combination of blocks can be used. Once the game starts, every block that a player steps on will disappear. If a player falls through a hole, he/she will continue to run on the layer below. Once a player falls through the final layer he/she loses the game and becomes a spectator for the remainder of the game. The last player remaining wins the game.

This fork was created in 2016 from the unsupported TNTRun by Shevchik for Minecraft v1.10, and has been improved and updated as new versions of Minecraft have been released. The latest version of TNTRun_reloaded requires a minimum Java version of 17, so is supported on servers running Minecraft versions 1.17.1 to 1.20.2.

The following description and features apply to the latest release. Some of the features will not be present in the older versions which are maintained and supported on an 'as is' basis, and will only be updated if a bug is reported or an existing feature breaks.

The plugin features a customisable shop where players can buy items such as weapons, armour, double-jumps, splash potions, snowballs (with knockback) and commands which run when the game starts. There is an option to enable PVP in an arena, assign kits, and the plugin also interfaces with HeadsPlus (by ThatsMusic99) allowing players to buy/wear custom heads during the game.

Optionally, a fee can be set to join each arena, which can be monetary or any Minecraft item such gold_nuggets. Rewards for winning the game can be set to any combination of coins, materials, XP or a command based reward. Scoreboards, leaderboards, placeholders and holograms are fully supported (see the Dependencies section below).
